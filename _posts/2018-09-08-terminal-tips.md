## Short tricks for long commands:     
- Use `Ctrl+A` and `Ctrl+E` to navigate to the beginning and end of the line respectively.   
- Hit `Ctrl+R` and enter a word/phrase from a previously used super long command and it will retrieve the last used command with the term.  

## Reusing previous commands
- `!!` is handy for reusing the previous command with the current command.  
- `!?` uses the argument of the previous command with the current command.

## Bash history
To avoid having a command added to your .bash_history file, prefix it with a space i.e. go with `  [command]` instead of <code>&nbsp;[command]</code>.    

## Pausing and running commands
Say, you have a terminal text editor open and you're in the process of editing it. You realize you want to test something out on the terminal.   
Instead of closing and re-opening it, you could use `Ctrl+Z` to pause the application and return to the terminal; followed by the `fg` command to return to it.

## Running commands after logging out of an SSH session. 
This one's for long commands in an SSH session.     
Nohup stands for 'no hangups'.   
Prefixing `nohup` lets you run time-taking commands in an SSH session after log out too.   
So a time-taking script.sh can be run remotely as `nohup sh script.sh`.

## Returning to a previous directory without a pwd:      
Say you accidentally change directories and want to return to the previous directory you were working in.     
`cd -` takes you back to it.
