### Stop/Start Displaying Terminal Input
    stty -echo
    stty echo
When `stty -echo` is run, input in the terminal won't be displayed.
When `stty echo` is run, input in the terminal will be displayed.

### Describe Filetype of File or Directory
    file [filename or dirname]
The command describes the type of file or directory provided as an argument along with a description of its contents.

### Create a typescript of terminal session
    script [dir/filename]
On executing the command, every command typed after it is logged and added to a typescript with the name `filename` in the destination described by `dir`. When we `cat filename`, the logged commands are executed again. Example:
    
    ~$ script script_file 
    Script started, file is script_file
    ~$ echo "hi this is in the script"
    hi this is in the script
    ~$echo "hello"
    hello
    ~$ exit
    exit
    Script done, file is script_file
    ~$
    ~$ cat script_file
    Script started on 2019-09-14 08:34:06+05:30
    ~$ echo "hi this is in the script"
    hi this is in the script
    ~$ echo "hello"
    hello
    # exit
    exit

    Script done on 2019-09-14 08:35:51+05:30

Here, when we run `cat script_file`, the commands logged under it are directly executed.

**Undoing a commit**  
Sometimes you may commit the wrong files to the repository and may want to entirely undo a commit. This can be done using the following command  
```$ git reset --soft ^HEAD~1 ```

**Modifying a commit by adding files**  
Sometimes you may want to add an another file to the existing commit. For that you first add the file to the staging area as follows  
```$ git add filename```  
and then commit using the ammend option  
```$ git commit --amend -m "Added this file"```  

**Syncing forked repository to the original repository**  
When you fork a repository, the fork contains all the files that were present in the original repository at the time of forking. Now after a certain period if you want to sync the forked repository to the upstream one the following commands have to be executed:  
Add remote of original repository in your cloned fork repository as follows
```
$ git remote add upstream git://github.com/github_handle/repo_name_you_forked_from.git  
$ git fetch upstream  
```  
Update your fork from original repo to reflect the changes made in original repository  

    $ git pull upstream master  
Finally to reflect these changes in your remote repository from your local repository  

    $ git push

### Reuse the previous command in present command
    ~$ apt install vlc-bin
    E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend - open (13: Permission denied)
    E: Unable to acquire the dpkg frontend lock (/var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend), are you root?
    ~$ sudo !!
    sudo apt install vlc-bin
    [sudo] password for abc: 

You can call the entire previous command with !!. This comes particularly useful when you have to run a command and realize that it needs root privileges.
