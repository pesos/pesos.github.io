- Collaboration happens on a large scale. A community based around the sharing of ideas and expertise can form around an Open Source project.
- You get a chance to work on amazing software that our world depends on, thus giving you a real chance to make a real-world impact!

### I'm sold. Now how exactly do I contribute to Open Source?

[*Still not sure about why you should participate in Open Source?*](/whats-in-it-for-me)

Ahh, now that's the tricky part.

Contributing to Open Source can be intimidating, especially for first timers. Often, you are dealing with large codebases and it is hard to know where to even start. Then the doubts creep in. Am I good enough? What if I do something wrong?

This is what PES Open Source aims to address. We want to provide a platform for us to support each other and bring our members to a point where they can comfortably and confidently make a real impact through Open Source collaboration.
