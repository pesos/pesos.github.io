To those of you unfamiliar with Rust and its related ideas such as ownership and borrowing, the rich features of the language, and the concurrency model, we have provided a learning path for you to get you up to speed.

Do note that you do not need to understand *everything* to start contributing – the issues labeled `first-timers-only` will help those of you get familiar with Git and the open source workflow without having to worry about understanding the codebase in detail.

Remember the `#rshark-help` channel is your friend, and we will address any question related to the project, Rust in general, or even the contribution process.

## Learning path for Rshark

The knowledge of the following will greatly aid you in contributing to grofer:

- Learn Rust and its concept of ownership, borrowing and lifetimes
- The various data types of Rust – structs, unions and enums, as well as pattern matching
- Concurrency features in Rust – threads, locks, smart pointers, atomic reference counters etc.
- Computer Networking
    - Various protocols involved like IPv4, IPv6, ARP, TCP, UDP, etc.
    - Packet formats based on the protocol.
- Basic understanding of the libraries used
    - `tui-rs` - [GitHub](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs) · [Docs](https://docs.rs/tui/0.10.0/tui/)
   - `libpnet` - [GitHub](https://github.com/libpnet/libpnet) · [Docs](https://docs.rs/pnet/0.26.0/pnet/)
